		ringSizeTitle: 'Two ring sizes in one pair of pliers',
		ringSizeText: 'Our innovative pliers allow you to use two different ring sizes without having to change tools. This makes your work more efficient. The pliers can be made in ring sizes from 12 mm to 30 mm, making them suitable for banding with identification or address rings from peregrine falcons to stone or sea eagles.',
		ringDestructionTitle: 'No damage to the ring',
		ringDestructionText: 'A major advantage is that the ring completely encloses the bird when closed, ensuring that no digits are damaged. This is especially important for ensuring the longevity and readability of the digits. This way, a lost and found bird can be quickly returned to its owner. Additionally, using this tool ensures that the ring is always pressed evenly and does not end up egg-shaped, as can happen with a water pump plier or combination plier due to point pressure.',
		easyHandlingTitle: 'Easy handling due to optimal leverage',
		easyHandlingText: 'The thoughtful design and optimal leverage mechanism make our pliers an extremely user-friendly product. The pliers close the ring with minimal effort. This ensures precise and effortless work even during longer banding sessions. The ergonomic design reduces hand fatigue and provides maximum comfort.',
		qualityTitle: 'Handcrafted quality',
		qualityText: 'Each pair of pliers is individually manufactured. The core of each plier is the jaws that enclose the ring. They are milled on the latest CNC machines and individually adjusted by hand. Our craftsmen use only the best materials to ensure that each pair of pliers meets the quality standard.',
